# F# science and math notebooks

A collection of F# notebooks used to explore scientific and mathematical topics, usually revolving around implementing the ideas from a specific book. Most of these are highly in-work or little small projects that I get to from time to time depending upon life and also which book I decide to pick up and try something out on. For books that appear, the goal is to eventually work through the book with a complete notebook resulting from that.

## Notebooks based on books

The below notebooks contains many images and plots, so it is **recommended to use the [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/) links** below since GitHub doesn't render notebooks with images very well.
